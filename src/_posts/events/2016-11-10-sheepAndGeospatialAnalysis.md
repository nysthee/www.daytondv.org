the Contrast Threshold Function and how we can use it to improve our visualizations. Sean will take us through a geospatial analysis he
did using the Texas department of licensing and regulation open data set. This is a lunchtime meetup at Applied Information Sciences in Beavercreek."

Many thanks to Evelyn Boettcher and Sean McCarty for volunteering to speak at our November event! This will be a lunchtime meetup in Beavercreek at Applied Information Sciences.

* 11:30am: Pizza, Sponsors, and Announcements

* 12:00pm: Resolve Your Sheep -
Visualizations showcasing data and insights are meant to be shown to others and it's natural to take for granted that if we can see it others can too. But, ...have you ever noticed/said/heard, "Wow, this graph looked so much better on my screen."  Why is that?  Why can I see it and my big boss cannot?  Two things come to play: the human eye and the display. The human eye's ability to resolve ("see") an object depends on the object's contrast with the background and the contrast spatial frequency which is represented by a Contrast Threshold Function (CTF).  One's personal CTF will also change in time, unfortunately for the worse as you get older. Once your graph is displayed, the medium that it is being displayed on or through will add to the CTF.  This spatial frequency response of the display system tends to play a large part in that blurry graph/font.  Evelyn Boettcher spent 4 years with the U.S. Army Human Performance group modeling how well Soldier can resolve their targets.  The goal of this talk is to make one cognizant how spatial frequency affects the eye's ability to see, so that your sheep can be resolved by your audience.

* 12:30pm: Geospatial Analysis of the Texas Department of Licensing & Regulation Open Data Set -
Sean McCarty will present a Geospatial Analysis of the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation Open Data set. Sean is an image & signal processing engineer that has experience implementing synthetic aperture radar image formation, signal processing, and real-time communication waveform generation solutions.

* 1:00pm: End
